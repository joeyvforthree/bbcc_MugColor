Mug Color (100 points)

Introduction
Jay S. has got himself in trouble! He had borrowed a friend's coffee mug and somehow lost it. As his
friend will be extremely angry when he finds out about it, Jay has decided to buy his friend a replacement
mug to try to control the damage.

Unfortunately, Jay does not remember the color of the mug he had borrowed. He only knows that the
color was one of White, Black, Blue, Red or Yellow.

Jay goes around his office asking his colleagues if they are able to recall the color but his friends don't
seem to remember the color of the mug either. What they do know is what color the mug definitely was
not.

Based on this information, help Jay figure out what the color of the mug was.

Input Specifications
Your program will take:
An input N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000) which denotes the number of people Jay questions regarding the
mug.

This will be followed by N strings S[1],S[2]...S[N] where S[I] denotes the response of person I to
Jay's question which is what color the mug definitely was not. S[I] will also be only one of the 5
colors namely White, Black, Blue, Red or Yellow.

Output Specifications
Based on the input, print out the color of the mug. The color of the mug can only be one of the 5 colors
namely White, Black, Blue, Red or Yellow.

You can safely assume that there always exists only one unique color that the mug can have.
